# VendingMachine
Vending Machine Kata

The whole of this test can be viewed in the default "ViewController" class generated by the default Xcode project.

The interface when launching this project is fairly rudimentary. Simple buttons and labels are used to convey user input and a couple of alerts are used to display feedback.

The customer starts with various coins and the machine also starts with coins it can use to make change. There are three of each item in the machine that can sell out. Inserted more money in the machine than is required will result in coins being placed in the change "slot". Customers must then press the "Collect Change" button to remove the coins from this slot and back into their funds. 

Inserting a penny will result in the coin going being rejected immediately and placed in the Returned Coins slot. Attempting to make a purchase without the required funds results in an alert showing how much the item is and how much money the customer has inserted.

Notes:
There is definitely a lot of room to expand on this project. From allowing additional currency types, pulling in dynamic data, using images, building a flexible UI... From a coding standpoint I would also expand by breaking this project up into different components that function independently from one another.
